## Abstract:

Quick! Help Speckle catch some fish with your spelling prowess!!! Speckle is a novel childrens game aimed at supporting spelling proficiency. In this application children will be able to listen to a word and then try spelling it on their own. If they get it right, Speckle will catch one fish and be one step closer to a full belly. If they don't quite get it right, they'll be shown what letters were slightly off.

## Context:

This is a group project during Mod 3 at Turing School of Software & Design. We were given approximately 1 week to create this project from scratch using the [provided comp](https://frontend.turing.edu/projects/module-3/stretch.html).

## Learning Goals:
- Learn and implement a completely new technology - Redux
- Gain competency with React fundamentals
- Test React components & asynchronous JS
- Practice refactoring
- Create a multi-page UX using Router
- Learn to deploy an application

## Challenges:
- Redux: This was our first time learning about as well as implementing Redux. While our application was relatively small it gave us a good opportunity to experiment and learn about the power that Redux offers to manage global state.
- React: This was our collective second React Application. We enjoyed continuing to learn about the features, functionality, and requirements for implementation within this library/framework.


## Installation Instructions:

1. Fork this repository.
2. Clone it to your local machine using the green `<> CODE` button and pasting that into your terminal with the the command: `git clone <paste here>`
3. Run the command: `cd Stretch-tech`
4. Run the command: `npm install`
5. Run the command: `npm start`
6. The application will open in your browser

## Ideas for future iterations 
- Add grade level options for words 
- Add a page where misspelled words go, or some sort of word bank for later practice
- Login for teachers and giving them the ability to create thier own list of words
